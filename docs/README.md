# Probabilistic Programming using Edward/TensorFlow

## ** The Material on this site and github would be updated in following months before and during the conference.

## Abstract

Researchers have built probabilistic models and deep learning models that have provided benefits in various domains. The probabilistic programming platforms and languages of today empower non-experts to create and apply such probabilistic models based on Bayesian inference techniques. In this tutorial, we combine the power of Edward and TensorFlow to teach how to apply probabilistic programming and deep learning for use cases such as dimensionality reduction and classification in computer vision and image processing.  

## Duration: Half day (3 hours, 30 minutes, plus 30 minutes break)

## Tutorial Objectives

* The audience will gain knowledge of the probabilistic programming.
* The tutorial will use TensorFlow Probability and Edward2 for two hands on examples.

## Tutorial Outline ( under revision)

The tutorial will cover the following sessions of 30 minutes each:

### Session 1: Introduction to Probabilistic Programming - Theory

* What is Probabilistic Programming
* Probabilistic Machine Learning
* Variational Inference

### Session 2: Probabilistic Programming Tools

* Bugs, Stan, Pyro
* Tensorflow Probability and Edward 2

### Session 3: Variational Autoencoders - Practical Hands-On

### Session 4: Bayesian Neural Network - Practical Hands-On

### Session 5: Road Ahead: Further Learning and Research Resources

## Prerequisite knowledge:

The audience should be aware of the basic probability, bayesian inference and deep learning algorithms. Basic knowledge of Python language and one of the deep learning frameworks such as PyTorch or TensorFlow will be useful.
